**Subject: Domain nameserver configuration and WordPress installation for hashhavenltd.com**

Hi Hostinger Support,

I need help with my domain hashhavenltd.com which is currently showing a parking page instead of my hosting space. Here are the details:

**Current Issue:**
- Domain: hashhavenltd.com
- Server: server2061 (Europe/Germany)
- Server IP: 82.198.227.29
- Current nameservers: ns1.dns-parking.com and ns2.dns-parking.com
- Problem: Domain shows parking page instead of my hosting space

**What I need help with:**

1. **Nameserver Configuration:**
   - What are the correct Hostinger nameservers for my hosting account?
   - Should I change from parking nameservers to hosting nameservers?
   - Or should I configure DNS A records to point to my server IP (82.198.227.29)?

2. **WordPress Installation:**
   - How do I install WordPress on hashhavenltd.com once the domain is properly configured?
   - I need the WordPress REST API to be accessible at: https://hashhavenltd.com/wp-json/wp/v2
   - I have a Next.js frontend that needs to connect to WordPress backend

3. **DNS Configuration:**
   - Need @ record pointing to 82.198.227.29
   - Need www CNAME pointing to hashhavenltd.com
   - Need to ensure SSL certificate works after configuration

**Goal:**
I want hashhavenltd.com to show my hosting space (not parking page) so I can install WordPress and connect it to my Next.js frontend application.

**Technical Details:**
- Hosting plan: Business hosting with 50GB disk space
- Need WordPress with REST API enabled
- Frontend will be deployed on Vercel
- Domain should resolve to hosting server, not parking page

Can you please guide me through the correct steps to configure the nameservers/DNS and install WordPress?

Thank you!
